Task 2:

Can this given bracket sequence [((())()(())]] be considered correct

To my opinion, it cannot be considered correct from a programming perspective, as in a software development, it should be one opening bracket and one closing bracket of each type
from the opposite part of the expression:
Here is the example:
[{()}]
So, when it comes to the question, I would suggest that it can be fixed like this:
[(())()(())] - 2nd and the bracket before the last one are removed 
[[(())()(())]] - 2nd bracket is replaced by "("
[((())()(()))] - bracket before the last one is replaced by ")"
